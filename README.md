# Git-commands-practice
Practise git commands using this repo!

### Nice commands to learn:
1. git init - Initialises git
2. git remote add origin "your_github_repo_link.git" - to access the github repo to work with (don't forget the .git at the end of the link)
3. git pull main - access the main branch
4. git add -A  - add all the files created to git
5. git commit -m "your_commit_description" - commit the changes
6. git branch branch_name - create a new branch called "branch_name"
7. git checkout branch_name - access the branch "branch_name" to work with
8. git merge branch_name - merge the branch with main (run the command while you are on the main branch)
9. git remote set-url origin "your_github_repo_link.git" - set your access back to your repo
10. git push - push all the commits into your github

### Extra commands (non-git):
FOR WINDOWSSS!
1. type nul > filename.file_type - creates a new file in the directory
2. notepad filename.file_type - edit your file contents through notepad (since cmd powershell doesn't have its own command line editor)
